The Solo video pipeline exists in this folder.  The pipeline works as follows:

vidout:
vidout is always running on Solo and handles resolution size changes
automatically.  It always sends rtp-encapsulated h.264 720p video
to Artoo on port 5550.  Depending on network conditions, it will reduce
the framerate of the video.  Specifically, if the number of transmit
retries on Solo eclipses 200, the framerate will be reduced based on the
following:

30fps -> 24fps -> 15fps -> 10fps -> 5fps

If the link continues to be bad, the framerate is held at 5fps.  Further work
could reduce the GOP or QUANT to reduce bitrate even further.  Additional
work should be done to support streaming different resolutions as well.

app_streamer:
app_streamer on Artoo takes data from port 5550 and passes it to
both the hdmiout as well as any connected mobile devices.  It sends full
frames at a time to mobile devices, but passes data byte-by-byte to hdmiout.

hdmiout:
hdmiout is always running, but waits to detect a connected HDMI cable before
starting the decoding pipeline.  It puts 720p video out on the HDMI port of Artoo
using the mfw_isink gstreamer plugin.

cleanlibs.sh:
cleanlibs is used to remove old Sculpture libraries that are no longer in use.
This is installed as a startup script, but can probably be removed in the future.
